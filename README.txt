# Coding examples from running projects by Leonie Villiger

## cosmo_identify_layers
* Script demonstrating basic data treatment mainly with numpy arrays and dictionaries
* Solved taks: Read 3D output file from numerical weather prediction model and find index of specific atmospheric layer. Repeat for list of dates. Store time series of identified indices in netCDF.

## machine_learning_project
* Script demonstrating understanding of training a neural network (NN); masterging of tensorflow and pandas
* Solved task: create and train NN that predicts cloud base height based on input of 5 meteorological variables (regression problem)

## plot_map_cosmo_echam
* Scripts demonstrating usage of multiple Python scripts (importing functions from other scripts) and calling Python script with Bash; mastering of matplotlib
* Solved taks: read output from 4 different numerical weather prediction models; interpolate variable to specific pressure level, create 2x2 panel plot
