cosmo_get_index_layer_inside_box.py
        script to identify atmospheric layers inside geographical box based on cloud water
        additionally cloud fraction at cloud base is calculated
        time series of identified layer indices and cloud base cloud fraction are written to netCDF
        applicable to data from COSMOiso simulations with 10km resolution (BIG_REF_v3), 5km, and 1km
